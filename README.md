Future of this project
-

I have built this project to be able to add any shape/size of multiblock and allow it to do anything within a gui. The multiblocks are fully customizable in code and dont have any hard limits. I stopped after 1 functional multiblock and 2 buildable multiblocks to show that the system can be used to make more than 1 type of multiblock but dont find it neccessary to code a whole other machine as the first one should show off what I can do.
